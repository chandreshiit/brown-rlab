Sparse Online Gaussian Process library
by Dan Grollman
Brown University
(dang_AT_cs.brown.edu)

This code is based on the work of Csato and Opper.  In particular, the
equations were drawn from Lehel Csato's PhD thesis (Aston University
2002:
http://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/bs/people/csatol/ogp/thesis/index.html).
The results of this code were checked against the ogp Matlab library,
also written by Csato and available at http://www.gaussianprocess.org/

I release this code for general non-profit and academic use, without
warrenty or guarentee of any kind.  If you wish to use / modify /
update / improve this code, please contact me.
