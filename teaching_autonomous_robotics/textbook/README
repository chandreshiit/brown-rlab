This document is an unfinished working draft for the "Teaching Autonomous Robotics" textbook, in development, based on Brown University course CS 148, "Building Intelligent Robots."  Although a work in progress, Chapters 2 and 3 provide a quick start guide for installing, using, and programming mobile robots with Player and ROS.
